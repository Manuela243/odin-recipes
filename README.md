<!--In the beggining it all looks lifeless since I will only use HTML-->
## First assignment
<p>For my first assignment from The Odin Project I will make a web page: <br>
<!--Still trying to figure out if this is an okay way to have breaks between the paragraphs-->
 <p><strong>"RECIPE PAGE"</strong></p>
<!--All my recipes will be available in "Index.html" file.-->
<p>What I used:</p>
<!--Later I will add more, but for now I will not use lists since there is only
one language I will use at the beggining-->
    <p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<p>For start, I will only be using HTML to make structure for my web page. </p>
<p>Later on, I will come back to use CSS to make it visiable appealing.</p>
<p>Made this using <strong>Virtual Box, on <em>Xubuntu Linux.</em> </strong></p>
<!--Since I started, I have been using Linux and I use Visual Code Studio. I downloaded everything
myself, with no help but by using Google-->
<!--I use Visual Code Studio on Windows 11 too-->
